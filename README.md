# virtual-letter

Sending a letter has become obsolete. One can send e-mails or messages over a
thousand ways on social media. But how about making a computer program for your
dearly beloved?

This app in Qt is a very basic stuff with a skeleton and a helper script to:

* Create a slideshow with 1 photo + 1 caption per slide.
* First slide has a text - the intro of the letter - and a start button.
* Last slide has a text - the outro of the letter - and a restart button.

The helper script **create.sh** creates one QML (that is, one slide) per picture
inside _fotos_.
