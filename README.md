# virtual-letter

Sending a letter has become obsolete. One can send e-mails or messages over a
thousand ways on social media. But how about making a computer program for your
dearly beloved?

## How it Works

This project creates a slideshow:

* Intro slide with a start button.
* 1 photo + 1 caption per slide.
* Outro slide with a restart button.

## How to Use

* Add your photos inside `photos`.
* Run `./create.sh`
* Customize text on:
    * `intro.qml`
    * `outro.qml`
    * Each slide file `slides/*.qml`
* Build and run the Qt app
